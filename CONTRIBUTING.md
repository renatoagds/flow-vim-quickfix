## How to File a Format Proposal

Since this project aims for clear, easy-to-understand flow messages, your input is
very valuable!

Did you find any flow error messages which were confusing to you and you want it to be
better? Please follow following steps:

1. Isolate your error (prevent noise of other flow errors)
2. Copy the output `flow --json`
3. Copy the output of `flow --json | flow-vim-quickfix`
4. Think about a format which would make more sense to you
5. Create an issue containing all the information acquired above
6. Profit.

Thanks,

Your feedback is very welcome :-)
